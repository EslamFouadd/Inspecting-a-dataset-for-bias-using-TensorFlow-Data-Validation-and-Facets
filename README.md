# Inspecting-a-dataset-for-bias-using-TensorFlow-Data-Validation-and-Facets
In this lab, we use TFDV to compute descriptive statistics that provide a quick overview of the data in terms of the features that are present and the shapes of their value distributions. We use Facets Overview to visualize these statistics using the Civil Comments dataset.
